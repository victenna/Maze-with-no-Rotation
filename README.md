# Maze-with-no-Rotation
A mini project for kids who are interested in Python programming and like math, physics and games. 
We present Python code that realizes maze game with Pygame library. Code is very simple (not more 
than 50 lines). You can create a game with any maze geometry (simple or complex) that can be imported 
as an image from an Internet. Presented code utilizes maze geometry and a player avatar (for example, 
square or ball) that can navigate that maze.  The complexity of the code (the number of lines) depends 
very little on the maze image geometry due to the utilizing of special Pygame function sprite.collide_mask 
which detects collision between  a player avatar and maze lines. So, if you want to use some specific maze 
instead current geometry you need to replace maze image without changing Python code. Files for modeling 
of this scenario can be downloaded free of charge at:
